### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About

I'm a fullstack developer, working with the web on solutions related to data (like web scraping) and apps (with React, Angular and VanillaJS), along with RESTful server services (using NodeJS and Mongo/Sql). I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and I'm currently studying for a post-graduate degree in software engineering.

## Recent work and study

Currently I'm working on big websites, with a CMS. Learning more about Jenkins, bundlers, gulp, project architecture, docker and design patterns. 

## Colaboration

I'm looking to learn and colaborate on projects related to what I already work with and with new technologies. If you want my help just contact me, and we can talk about your project, whether its open-source or a business project.
