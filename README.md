### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About

I'm a fullstack developer, working with the web on solutions related to data (like web scraping) and apps (with React, Angular and VanillaJS), along with RESTful server services (using NodeJS and Mongo). I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

## Recent work and study

Currently I'm learning more about React, mongoose and advanced server side code, with authentication, project structure and Modularization using AWS services, like AWS Lambda. Working with small projects as a freelancer.

## Colaboration

I'm looking to learn and colaborate on projects related to what I already work with and with new technologies. If you want my help just contact me, and we can talk about your project, whether its open-source or a business project.
