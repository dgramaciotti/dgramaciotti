### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About

I'm a fullstack developer, having worked like that for around 5 years. I have worked in small, medium and large teams, in many different industries. I like javascript and stuff related to that.

## Recent work and study

Currently I'm working for toyota with serverless. Helping scale applications and rethink architecture patterns.

## Colaboration

I'm looking to learn and colaborate on projects related to what I already work with and with new technologies. If you want my help just contact me, and we can talk about your project, whether its open-source or a business project.
